# Landing Page

A simple landing page built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.  
This project was created purely for learning purposes and to practice basic HTML and CSS layout skills.

## Overview
The page includes a header with navigation links, a hero section, an information section, a quote, and a call-to-action area, followed by a footer.  
It’s a straightforward static page with no functionality — just good old HTML and CSS styling.
